        DataViz Studio is a tool for designers to better understand how to use
        charts within their designs and a chart generator where designers can
        customize and export charts as an SVG or PNG using real data.
        <br></br>
        <br></br> QuickBooks is a product that benefits a lot from data
        visualizations and I wanted to help our designers feel confident when
        adding charts into their designs. Oftentimes designers would throw in an
        extra chart to fill an empty space, but that can result in confusion for
        end users. Another problem I encountered was that designers would make
        charts from scratch that look amazing in a wireframe, but once a
        developer built it and added data, it didn’t look as good or wasn’t
        great at conveying meaningful information.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        To combat these struggles, DataViz Studio has two parts:
        <ol>
          <li>
            DataViz Studio’s gallery has filters on the left panel to help
            designers narrow down which charts work best for their intended
            application. Each item in the gallery includes how to use each chart
            and best practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chart editor allows designers to paste data from a spreadsheet
            (perhaps provided by a dev or data analyst) into the editor to
            create their own charts. They can then customize size, colors,
            labels, titles, and more before exporting to a PNG or an SVG that is
            easy to edit in Figma, Illustrator, or another editor.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br></br>I designed and built DataViz Studio using React, d3.js, and
        react-datasheet while working as a design technologist at Intuit.

        Race to Hunts Point is a board game for high school aged students that
        aims to demystify the food system and answer questions like - Where does
        our food come from? How does it get to the grocery store? Why is it
        possible to have blueberries year round?
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We were inspired by the complex distribution system within NYC and Hunts
        Point, which is a major food distribution point in the city. We decided
        to zoom out and focus on North + South America so we could capture part
        of a global system.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The game emulates the process of managing growing produce and then
        moving the food to NYC. Pathways on the board are based on actual
        shipping routes. Resource management is key in the game. Players have to
        think about time (seasonality + perishability of foods, shipping times),
        resources (money, trading with players), technology (pay to increase
        efficiency at farming and/or shipping phases), and supply + demand at
        the final destination.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We quickly iterated through several different versions of the game,
        making sure to playtest with high schoolers and get feedback from game
        designers along the way. Throughout we explored how to make the visual
        design reflect the textures and topographies of farms and spaces that
        food moves through on its way to us. For the board we experimented with
        different materials and used rapid prototyping tools like laser cutters,
        CNC (Shapeoko + Othermill), and 3D printers.

        devices. I built these projects using Arduino microcontrollers (MKR1000,
        Micro, Uno, ESP8266), a variety of analog and digital sensors, and
        different data protocols (sACN/DMX, HID/USB, MIDI, TCP).

        There is a rule of physics that says liquids are able to take the shape
        of any container. Cats also follow this rule, and therefore are liquid.
        I’m proving that it’s true, even in the browser. You may need to disable
        your popup blocker to view the demo. Works best on a desktop or laptop.

        Sound Tent is a playful, sensory space for two people to connect through
        interactions with sound and light. Buttons create melodic sounds,
        similar to a piano, and the knobs control the other person's volume and
        octave. In the middle of the console, they can tap on capacitive touch
        pads to create percussive sounds. As the two users play together and
        create more sound, the lights around them get brighter.

        Historically, artists have used self-portraits as a way to express
        different facets of their identities. Now selfies and filters are often
        used to create illusions or sell things to us. I invite you to create a
        selfie portrait with your webcam by answering simple questions about
        yourself. Instead of beautifying or morphing your face, you will add to
        your image through self reflection.

        The TcFLEX-SOLO is a bracket designed to mount the Sonos Play:1 or
        Play:3 directly to the wall. This articulating bracket also allows the
        SONOS speaker to be mounted in either a horizontal or vertical position
        for optimal placement in any room. Unlike other competitors like Flexson
        and Cavus, the TcFLEX-SOLO conceals the outlet and power cord.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <u>My Role:</u> I was tasked to develop a low profile wall bracket that
        could fit both the SONOS Play:1 and Play:3, while concealing power cords
        and utilizing already in-stock parts. I did all design and validation on
        the sheet metal parts and the install instructions. To lower costs, I
        also simplified existing designs for the articulating mount parts.

        Aros is a spice dispenser designed for visually impaired people to
        accurately dispense spices in 1/4 teaspoon quantities. Intended to be an
        intuitive experience for users with limited or no vision, Aros has
        tactile indicators, high contrast colors, and a unique form to take into
        account that visually impaired users tend to use their fingers rather
        than their thumbs.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        <u>My Role:</u> I played a large role in identifying the user scenario,
        market research, and competition analysis. I did the engineering for the
        measurement and dispensing mechanism and conducted force analyses on all
        mechanical components. I also created build plans for injection mold
        mass manufacturing and aided in the fabrication of the proof-of-concept.
        <br></br> <br></br>The Aros proof-of-concept was fabricated from 3-D
        printed ABS plastic and NinjaFlex, laser cut clear acrylic, steel pins,
        a spring, and magnets.

        Makeathon is an annual 36-hour physical product design competition that
        brings college students from all disciplines together to turn their
        ideas into functional prototypes. At the first Makeathon, 80 students
        from 6 colleges utilized rapid prototyping tools at TechShop Detroit to
        build a chair for arthritis sufferers, an extendable skateboard, modular
        dorm furniture, and more. At Makeathon's conclusion, teams pitched their
        product to a panel of experts and won $1,000 in awards. Check out some

        What makes a person go from showing initial interest to taking that next
        step? We wanted to encourage students at Detroit Community High School
        to ask the same question.
        <br></br>
        <br></br> DCH Spark is a series of workshops that aims to build off of
        students' passion for music and working with their hands by providing
        resources and a space where students can explore the intersection of
        music and technology. The projects we developed for DCH Spark involve
        creating speakers out of magnets and a styrofoam cup and building a
        finished wooden speaker. We want this program to be a spark for
        students, igniting a passion for continuous learning and lifelong
        curiosity.
