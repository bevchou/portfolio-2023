        I prototyped a series of functional physical interfaces that communicate
        with other devices. I built these projects using Arduino
        microcontrollers (MKR1000, Micro, Uno, ESP8266), a variety of analog and
        digital sensors, and different data protocols (sACN/DMX, HID/USB, MIDI,
