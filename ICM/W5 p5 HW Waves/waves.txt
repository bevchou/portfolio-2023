SUN DON'T SHINE IN THE SHADE
BIRD CAN'T FLY IN A CAGE
EVEN WHEN SOMEBODY GO AWAY
THE FEELINGS DON'T REALLY GO AWAY
THAT'S JUST THE WAVE
WAVES DON'T DIE
LET ME CRASH HERE FOR THE MOMENT
I DON'T NEED TO OWN IT
NO LIE
WAVES DON'T DIE BABY
LET ME CRASH HERE FOR A MOMENT
BABY I DON'T I DON'T NEED TO OWN YOU
